# Hi, I’m Connor — Data Product Manager / Builder

I turn messy business questions into **shippable data products**. My sweet spot is the seam between **analytics, platform, and product**: shaping requirements with stakeholders, instrumenting data pipelines, and launching simple apps/dashboards that change decisions.

**Currently:** Senior Customer Information researcher at Grainger building member analytics and data tooling. Actively exploring PM/GPM roles in data platform, analytics tooling, and AI‑adjacent products.
